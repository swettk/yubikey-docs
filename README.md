This is a practical guide to using [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/faq/yubikey/) as a [SmartCard](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38924/how-does-storing-gpg-ssh-private-keys-on-smart-cards-compare-to-plain-usb-drives) for storing GPG encryption and signing keys. An authentication key can also be created for SSH and used with [gpg-agent](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/188668/how-does-gpg-agent-work/188813#188813).

Keys stored on a smartcard like YubiKey are more secure than ones stored on disk and are convenient enough for everyday use.

Instructions written for OSX using YubiKey 4 in OTP+CCID mode. Note, older YubiKeys are limited to 2048 bit RSA keys. The following has been tested on OSX 10.11.4.

# Install required software

You will need to install the following software:

Homebrew, an alternative package manager for OSX:

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Once homebrew has been installed, run:

    $ brew update

Install the necessary packages:

    $ brew install git-crypt yubikey-personalization socat
    $ brew install gpg-agent gnupg2
    $ brew cask install gpg-suite

# Configure the Yubikey

Once the packages have been installed, we need to modify the Yubikey configuration to run in OTP and CCID mode. To do this, run the following command:

    $ ykpersonalize -m82
    Firmware version 4.3.1 Touch level 517 Program sequence 1

    The USB mode will be set to: 0x82

    Commit? (y/n) [n]: y

# Creating keys

## Create temporary working directory for GPG

Create a temporary directory which won't survive a [reboot](https://serverfault.com/questions/377348/when-does-tmp-get-cleared):

    $ export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d) ; echo $GNUPGHOME
    `/var/folders/m_/t3y0ptl111zd0kbs6590gw_40000gn/T/tmp.4dMGGCBi`

## Create configuration

Paste the following [text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2500436/how-does-cat-eof-work-in-bash) into a terminal window to create a [recommended](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf) GPG configuration:

    $ cat << EOF > $GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf
    default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAMELLIA256 CAMELLIA192 CAMELLIA128 TWOFISH
    cert-digest-algo SHA512
    keyid-format 0xlong
    use-agent
    lock-never
    EOF

## Create master key

Generate a new key with GPG, selecting RSA (sign only), the appropriate keysize (4096), and no expiration date. The following procedure will also prompt to create and confirm a unique passphrase. 

    $ gpg --full-generate-key

    Please select what kind of key you want:
       (1) RSA and RSA (default)
       (2) DSA and Elgamal
       (3) DSA (sign only)
       (4) RSA (sign only)
    Your selection? 4
    RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
    What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
    Requested keysize is 4096 bits
    Please specify how long the key should be valid.
             0 = key does not expire
          <n>  = key expires in n days
          <n>w = key expires in n weeks
          <n>m = key expires in n months
          <n>y = key expires in n years
    Key is valid for? (0) 0
    Key does not expire at all
    Is this correct? (y/N) y

    GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

    Real name: Firstname Lastname
    Email address: firstname.lastname@wheniwork.com
    Comment:
    You selected this USER-ID:
        "Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@wheniwork.com>"

    Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
    You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

    We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
    some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
    disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
    generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

    Note that this key cannot be used for encryption.  You may want to use
    the command "--edit-key" to generate a subkey for this purpose.

Keep this passphrase handy as you'll need it throughout.

## Save Key ID

Export the key ID as a [variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1158091/defining-a-variable-with-or-without-export/1158231#1158231) for use throughout the configuration process:

    $ KEYID=0xF932D46EFBBF395C

## Add a photo

Next you will want a real picture of you and shouldn't be bigger than 240x288 and limit it to less then 14KB. Use the following commands to add the photo.

    $ gpg --edit-key $KEYID

    [ultimate] (1). Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@wheniwork.com>

    gpg> addphoto

    Pick an image to use for your photo ID.  The image must be a JPEG file.
    Remember that the image is stored within your public key.  If you use a
    very large picture, your key will become very large as well!
    Keeping the image close to 240x288 is a good size to use.

    Enter JPEG filename for photo ID: /Users/firstnamelastname/Desktop/photo.jpg
    Is this photo correct (y/N/q)? y

    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
    user: "Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@wheniwork.com>"
    4096-bit RSA key, ID 0xF932D46EFBBF395C, created 2016-08-03

    [ unknown] (2)  [jpeg image of size 2750]

    gpg> save

## Create revocation certificate

Create a way to revoke your keys in case of loss or compromise, an explicit reason being optional:

    $ gpg --gen-revoke $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/revoke.txt

    sec  4096R/0xF932D46EFBBF395C 2016-05-24 Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@wheniwork.com>

    Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
    Please select the reason for the revocation:
      0 = No reason specified
      1 = Key has been compromised
      2 = Key is superseded
      3 = Key is no longer used
      Q = Cancel
    (Probably you want to select 1 here)
    Your decision? 1
    Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
    >
    Reason for revocation: Key has been compromised
    (No description given)
    Is this okay? (y/N) y

    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
    user: "Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@wheniwork.com>"
    4096-bit RSA key, ID 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB, created 2016-05-24

    ASCII armored output forced.
    Revocation certificate created.

    Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
    access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
    It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
    your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
    your machine might store the data and make it available to others!

## Back up master key

Save a copy of the private key block:

    $ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/master.key

## Create subkeys

Edit the key to add subkeys:

    $ gpg --expert --edit-key $KEYID

    gpg (GnuPG/MacGPG2) 2.0.30; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

### Signing key

First, create a [signing key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5421107/can-rsa-be-both-used-as-encryption-and-signature/5432623#5432623), selecting RSA (sign only):

    gpg> addkey
    Key is protected.

    You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for

## Export subkeys

Save a copy of your subkeys:

    $ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/mastersub.key

    $ gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/sub.key
    
## Back up everything

Once keys are moved to hardware, they cannot be extracted again (otherwise, what would be the point?), so make sure you have made a backup before proceeding.

Insert the USB thumbdrive you were provided by WIW and backup the temporary GPG working directory:

    $ cp -avi $GNUPGHOME /Volumes/WIW_USB_THUMBDRIVE/
    /var/folders/m_/t3y0ptl111zd0kbs6590gw_40000gn/T/tmp.LXjFxkDy -> /Volumes/WIW_USB_THUMBDRIVE/tmp.LXjFxkDy

## Configure YubiKey

Plug in your YubiKey and configure it:

    $ ykpersonalize -m82
    Firmware version 4.2.7 Touch level 527 Program sequence 4

    The USB mode will be set to: 0x82

    Commit? (y/n) [n]: y

> The -m option is the mode command. To see the different modes, enter ykpersonalize –help. Mode 82 (in hex) enables the YubiKey as a composite USB device (HID + CCID) and allows OTPs to be emitted while in use as a smart card.  Once you have changed the mode, you need to re-boot the YubiKey – so remove and re-insert it.

## SSH

### Update configuration

Paste the following text into a terminal window to create a [recommended](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg-agent.conf) GPG agent configuration:

    $ cat << EOF > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
    pinentry-program /usr/local/MacGPG2/libexec/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac
    enable-ssh-support
    write-env-file
    use-standard-socket
    default-cache-ttl 600
    max-cache-ttl 7200
    debug-level advanced
    log-file /var/log/gpg-agent.log
    EOF

### Replace ssh-agent with gpg-agent

    $ pkill ssh-agent
    $ pkill gpg-agent
    $ eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support --use-standard-socket --log-file ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.log --write-env-file)

### Copy public key to server

Copy and paste the following output to the server authorized keys file:

    $ ssh-add -L
    ssh-rsa AAAAB4NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAz[...]zreOKM+HwpkHzcy9DQcVG2Nw== cardno:000605553211

### Connect with public key authentication

Run the following command. 

    $ ssh -T git@github.com -vvv

You will be prompted to enter your PIN. Output:

    [...]

# Share your public keys

Run the following clone command to get the gpg keys public repo.

    git clone https://github.com/wheniwork/public_gpg_keys

Add your key:

    git 

# Setup Git for signing

You will want to use the following command to make git use the signing key:

    git config --global user.signingkey <key id>

To sign a commit, use the following command:

    git commit -a -S -m "<message>"

# Yubikey Touch Password Disable

To disable the single password touch feature. On MacOS you will need to download yubiswitch from Download here You will need to find the product id using the ioreg tool. Using brew you will need to install the following packages:

    brew update && brew tap jlhonora/lsusb && brew install lsusb

Once those are installed run the following command and find to find idProduct.

    ioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0 -x | grep Yubikey -A10 | grep Product

which will output something like this:

    "idProduct" = 0x405
    "iProduct" = 0x2
    "USB Product Name" = "Yubikey 4 OTP+CCID"

Once you have yubiswitch installed and launched. Go to the preferences and set Yubikey ProductID to what the ioreg command returned for a value. Once you do that you can now enable and disable the yubikey using this. This disables the touch password feature. This shouldn't effect the gpg keys that you use for ssh and git signing.

# Troubleshooting

- If you don't understand some option, read `man gpg`.

- If you encounter problems connecting to YubiKey with GPG, simply try unplugging and re-inserting your YubiKey, and restarting the `gpg-agent` process.

- If you receive the error, `gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available` - you likely need to install GnuPG version 2.x.

- If you receive the error, `Yubikey core error: no yubikey present` - you likely need to install newer versions of yubikey-personalize as outlined in [Install required software](#install-required-software).

- If you receive the error, `Yubikey core error: write error` - YubiKey is likely locked. Install and run yubikey-personalization-gui to unlock it.

- If you receive the error, `Key does not match the card's capability` - you likely need to use 2048 bit RSA key sizes.

- If you totally screw up, you can [reset the card](https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html).
